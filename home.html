            <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
            <p>I am currently working as a software developer at Andesa Services. I mainly work on a policy lifecycle solution application using Java, Java Swing, and PL/SQL. I also work on another application using Angular, Java and PL/SQL. I graduated from Augustana College with B.A. majoring in computer science and minoring in data science and mathematics. Following that, I became a web developer for Dixon Automatic Tool before I landed in Andesa.
                <br/><br/>
                I am on a constant search for new information and knowledge pertain to computer science. I like to stay up to date on the latest frameworks and updates in the software development world. I have a particular interest in full-stack development. I have been working on full stack since I graduated undergrad. 
                <br/><br/>
                I am equally dedicated to polishing my development skills by working on personal projects. I have worked on two projects out on the play store and one on the app store.
