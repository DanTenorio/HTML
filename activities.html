                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>I have been playing the trombone since I was 11. I joined my school's band when I was in 6th grade and have been playing since.
                    I played in multiple bands in college including the Augustana Symphonic Band, Augustana Jazz Band, and the Augustana Concert Band.
                    I enjoyed playing the trombone for many years and it has taught me a lot. It taught me practice isn't good enough, but perfect practice is. Also it gave 
                    me leadership opportunities as a section leader.
                </p>

                <h2>Martial Arts</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been doing martial arts since I was 13. Martial arts is a pasttime I continue today along with my family.

                <h2>Gardening</h2>
                <p>I recently picked up gardening as a hobby. It is a hobby of patience and consistency. The rewards reaped from gardening are delicous!
                    My favorite plants to grow include tomatoes, cucumbers, and kohlrabi. A kohlrabi is radish-like vegetable and it's also known as a german radish.

                <h2>Hiking and Camping and Fishing</h2>
                <p>I enjoy the great outdoors. Even though Illinois isn't known for the outdoors, there are quite a few camping areas with astounding natural beauty.
                    I enjoy going for a hike, setting up a tent then going out to catch dinner at the nearest lake or river.
