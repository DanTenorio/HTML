        <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
        <p>I am currently working as a software developer at Andesa Services. I mainly work on a policy lifecycle
            solution application using Java, Java Swing, and PL/SQL. I also work on another application using Angular,
            Java and PL/SQL. I have a B.A. degree in Computer Science, as well as minors in Data Science and
            Mathematics. Following that, I became a web developer for Dixon Automatic Tool before I
            landed in Andesa.
            <br /><br />
            I am constantly searching for new information and knowledge pertaining to computer science. I stay
            up to date on the latest frameworks and updates in the software development world. One particular
            interest of mine is in full stack development. I have been working on full stack since I graduated
            undergrad.For full stack development, I like to use React for the frontend, Java or node.js for the backend
            and MonogoDB for the database.
            <br /><br />
            I am equally dedicated to polishing my development skills by working on personal projects. I have worked on
            two projects out on the Google Play store and one on the iOS app store. The app on both app stores have is
            full stack application created with React and Java. The app only on the Google PlayStore was created in
            Android Studio. For more information check out my projects page.
