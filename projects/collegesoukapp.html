        <h1>College Essentials</h1>
        <p>
            College Essentials started out with me and an alumnus from Augustana College. We wanted to create a website
            that college students could use to buy and sell books to each other. His Senior Inquiry(SI) was our jumping
            off point for the project. His SI was mostly the frontend of the website and barebones for the backend. The
            frontend was done in React and the backend was Java and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spearheaded the design and feel of the app by creating the logo in photoshop and color scheme for the web
            app. I also worked on the API for the web app, but was mainly focused on the frontend. We decided to move
            the web app into a phone app for iOS and Android using React native. With our main focus on the phone app,
            we decided to add a lot more than selling and buying books.
        </p>
        <p>
            We added many new features to the apps including ridesharing, a messaging system, and made the bookstore
            into a store where you could buy and sell anything. With our new added features we started to recieve a
            lot of new users and with that server costs started increasing. We eventually had reduced our server
            costing to 15% of the original costs using caching.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our app is free to check out in the iOS App Store and Google Play Store. We also have a landing page up
            check it out at <a href="http://collegesouk.com">collegesouk.com</a>
