            Morse Code Android Application
        </h1>
        <p>
            For my Senior Inquiry(SI) at Augustana College I created an android phone application
            using Android Studion, Firebase, and Gradle. I was in a team of 4 members tasked with helping
            a professor make an app. The professor was a hobbyist H.A.M. radio user and wanted to create an
            application to train amatuer radio operators for H.A.M. radio competitions. There were many setbacks
            and many hurdles to overcome as nobody in the team had experience with phone app development or
            developing a large project with a team.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first hurdle we had to overcome was what to use to create our phone application. There are many ways
            to go about making a phone application and we were overwhelmed with all the choices available to use such
            as React native, Flutter, etc... We decided to use Android Studio since it was supported by Google to make
            Google Play Store apps, we could write our code in Java which is what we use, and most of the team members
            had Android phones to work with. Once we started developing the app, technical issues started happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two main technical issues arose. The first was how to deal with call-signs and the other was how to deal
            with sounds. In H.A.M. Radio usage, call-signs have significant meaning such as country of origin and name.
            We decided to use a database full of in use call-signs and had to decide how to store them, either in the
            app or in a database. We decided to use a database in case we had to change call-signs. We use Google's
            Firebase to store the call-signs. Then the other issue was how to deal with sound. H.A.M. radios uses radio
            waves which is not compatible with digital phones so we had to find a way to deal with how to project sound
            and create sound.Usually phone apps play a sound file such as an mp3 file. We had to create a sound file
            that recreates an analog sound because H.A.M. radios had randomness to their sound along with other radio
            frequencies disturbing the original.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had to recreate radio waves and turn them into a digital format that the phone could use. We accomplished
            this by creating an array of numbers that represented a radio wave at a certain frequency and amplitude.
            Then we used an external library to convert the wave into a sound file which the phone could then play.
            After that we had to figure out how sound waves interact with each other to see how we would have to
            create sound files. Once all this was complete we had a finished app.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app was completed and included highest scoring board along with settings that made playing easier or
            more difficult. The code can be found on github and the app was released to the Google Play Store, but is
            no longer maintained.
